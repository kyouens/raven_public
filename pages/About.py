# About

## Overview

Raven is a regulatory assistant designed to answer questions about laboratory regulations. Raven employs a [large language model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/) to provide answers based on guidelines from regulatory authorities. Its goal is to streamline and accelerate the process of ensuring laboratory compliance and safety.

## Features

- Answers complex regulatory questions in plain language
- Supplies links to source documents
- Tuned to minimize [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) and other undesirable behaviors that may arise with LLMs

## How it Works

Raven uses a technique known as [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401v4). In this method, an LLM's capabilities are enhanced by an external database of regulatory documents. Raven employs a [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db) to identify the most pertinent regulatory documents based on the user's inquiry. The LLM then synthesizes the question and the retrieved documents to formulate the most accurate answer.

## Technologies

Raven is coded in Python and utilizes open-source or readily available commercial services for its infrastructure and user interface.
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com): This API offers an interface to access multiple machine learning models developed by OpenAI, including conversational agents based on the GPT architecture.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io): An open-source Python library designed to ease the creation of web apps and data dashboards.
- [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com): This open-source framework simplifies building applications using LLMs by orchestrating the conversation flow, routing questions to the appropriate natural language processing models, and retrieving answers.
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech): An open-source vector similarity database and search engine that powers the application's query handling and data retrieval capabilities.

## Disclaimer

Raven is a prototype and should not be used in an actual laboratory setting. *Raven makes mistakes, so do not depend on its answers for regulatory compliance.* Raven is not a substitute for laboratory expertise or professional regulatory advice.
